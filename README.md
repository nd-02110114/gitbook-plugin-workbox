# Gitbook WorkBox Plugin

This plugin uses WorkBox - a module written by Google - to automatically generate a service worker and 
include it in your gitbook output. 

## Installing

Add this to your gitbook by including it in your book.json file.

```

Be sure to run `gitbook install` before building your book, or as part of your automated build process.
